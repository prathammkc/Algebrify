# Algebrify

**Algebrify** is a web-based tool for converting arithmetic expressions between infix, postfix, and prefix notations. <br>
Built with Flask, this application allows users to easily perform conversions and visualize different representations of arithmetic expressions.<br>

[Watch Project Demo](https://github.com/prathammkc/Algebrify/blob/main/Algebrify.mp4)

## Features

- Convert infix expressions to postfix and prefix notations
- Convert postfix expressions to infix and prefix notations
- Convert prefix expressions to infix and postfix notations
- User-friendly web interface with real-time results

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For the core logic of expression conversion.
- **Flask**: For the backend web framework.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the frontend interface.
- **Stack data structure** : For the conversion of expressions.

## Installation
